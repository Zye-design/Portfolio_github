My Personal Portfolio website

# Zye-Portfolio
This is my personal Portfolio webpage that showcase my work flow
and skills over time although not a total representation 
of my coding and programming prowells.
In creating this i had a few downtime and needed to research 
more but when done it was worth the stress.

I was motivated into building this after i became confident of my skills 
and capable of completing projects solo.
